# Eat-Da-Burger
This is a burger logging application that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a user made ORM. This application was designed using the Model-View-Controller design technique. 

I am the sole contributor to this application.

# Technologies used
* JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and Handlebars were used to dynamically update the frontend of this application
* Node.js and Express.js were used for the backend serverside funtionality, including handling of API's
* MySQL was used as the database to hold all the applications information. All database queries were carried out using a custom made ORM.
